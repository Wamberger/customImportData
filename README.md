The program/script is part of software program and is not standalone executable. Therefore, you will need to write some additional code to run it. The code is for representative matter and was modified as well as simplified due to copy rights - as such it differs from the original program.

The script starts with function 'mapping' in the file 'mapping.py'.

The import csv data can be read and loop with default - defined and wanted header - or with custom mapping, where header is specified in properties. With additional settings the fields can be modified with 'if statements' as well as one attribute can have value of more attributes which can be modified - e.g. lower case etc. The mapping also validate and convert values into correct datatype, and insert them into previous created class of classes (adaptation to the older code).

INFO: This is an upgrade and optimized version of the older code and adapted to the older program structure. Look the file 'previousMapping'.
